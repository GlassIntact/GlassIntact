                        Hi I'm Kristen! I was born August 3rd, 2003 and am currently studying computer science at uOttawa. <br>
                        To be honest, unlike normal people, my hobbies are everchanging. In fact, by the time your reading this, I've probably changed my hobby to another... <br>
                        However, a hobby that I continue to go back to is listening to true crime podcasts (specifically Rotten Mango). <br>
                        Another thing about myself is my favourite colour is every single colour, as long as its in a pastel shade!
