                        Hi I'm Kristen! I was born August 3rd, 2003 and am currently studying computer science <br>at uOttawa. 
                        To be honest, unlike normal people, my hobbies are everchanging. In fact, <br>by the time your reading this, I've probably changed my hobby to another... <br>
                        However, a hobby that I continue to go back to is listening to true crime podcasts <br>(specifically Rotten Mango). 
                        Another thing about myself is my favourite colour<br> is every single colour, as long as its in a pastel shade!
