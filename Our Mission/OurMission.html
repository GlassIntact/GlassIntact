        <div id="description">
    		<p>A 2015 study out of San Francisco estimated that one-third of sexual assault cases involved a "date rape drug". These substances are unknowingly slipped into drinks, leaving the victims vulnerable to theft, kidnapping and drug-facilitated sexual assault (DFSA). With an alarming number of cases each year, we, at GlassIntact, firmly believe that it is about time something is done about this.</p>

    		<p>We believe you should be able to drink safely anywhere you go. Whether youâ€™re in a restaurant, at parties or nightclubs, our drinkwares will monitor anything you drink and look for traces of date rape drugs through a detector embedded into the glass. The moment something suspicious is detected, an LED light at the bottom of your glass will flash, making it <strong>extremely</strong> visible that your drink has been contaminated.</p>

    		<p>Through our products, we hope to save more people from consuming spiked drinks. Your priority is to have fun while we ensure your drinks are 100% safe.</p>
